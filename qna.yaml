    ## · Measurement of goodwill

    The BNP Paribas Group tests goodwill for impairment on a regular basis.

    - Cash-generating units

    The BNP Paribas Group has split all its activities into cash-generating units 2 representing major business lines. This split is consistent with the Group's organisational structure and management methods, and reflects the independence of each unit in terms of results and management approach. It is reviewed on a regular basis in order to take account of events likely to affect the composition of cash-generating units, such as acquisitions, disposals and major reorganisations.

    - Testing cash-generating units for impairment

    Goodwill allocated to cash-generating units is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that a unit may be impaired, by comparing the carrying amount of the unit with its recoverable amount. If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, an irreversible impairment loss is recognised, and the goodwill is written down by the excess of the carrying amount of the unit over its recoverable amount.

    - Recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit

    The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is the higher of the fair value of the unit less costs to sell, and its value in use.

    Fair value is the price that would be obtained from selling the unit at the market conditions prevailing at the date of measurement, as determined mainly by reference to actual prices of recent transactions involving similar entities or on the basis of stock market multiples for comparable companies.

    Value in use is based on an estimate of the future cash flows to be generated by the cash-generating unit, derived from the annual forecasts prepared by the unit's management and approved by Group Executive Management, and from analyses of changes in the relative positioning of the unit's activities on their market. These cash flows are discounted at a rate that reflects the return that investors would require from an investment in the business sector and region involved.

  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: In the financial statements for the first half of 2024, a Cash-Generating Unit (CGU) is defined as a major business line within the BNP Paribas Group. The Group divides its activities into CGUs, which are consistent with its organizational structure and management methods. These units operate independently in terms of results and management and are regularly reviewed to reflect events like acquisitions, disposals, or major reorganizations.
    question: How does the BNP Paribas Group define a Cash-Generating Unit (CGU) in the context of the financial statements for the first half of 2024?

  - answer: During the first half of 2024, the BNP Paribas Group tested goodwill for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of each CGU with its recoverable amount. The test is conducted annually or when there are indications of impairment. If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, the goodwill is written down, and an irreversible impairment loss is recognized, based on the excess of the carrying amount over the recoverable amount.
    question: How did the BNP Paribas Group test for goodwill impairment in its Cash-Generating Units (CGUs) during the first half of 2024?

  - answer: For the first half of 2024, the recoverable amount of a CGU was calculated as the higher of its fair value less costs to sell, or its value in use. Fair value was determined using market conditions such as recent sales of similar entities or stock market multiples. Value in use was based on future cash flows forecasted by the unit's management, which were then discounted at a rate reflecting the return required by investors in the specific business sector and region.
    question: What methodology was used by the BNP Paribas Group to calculate the recoverable amount of Cash-Generating Units (CGUs)?

    ## Measurement of expected credit losses

    Expected credit losses are defined as an estimate of credit losses (i.e. the present value of all cash shortfalls) weighted by the probability of occurrence of these losses over the expected life of the financial instruments. They are measured on an individual basis, for all exposures.

    In practice, for exposures classified in stage 1 and stage 2, expected credit losses are measured as the product of the probability of default ("PD"), loss given default ("LGD") and exposure at default ("EAD"), discounted at the effective interest rate of the exposure (EIR). They result from the risk of default within the next 12 months (stage 1), or from the risk of default over the maturity of the facility (stage 2). In the consumer credit specialist business, because of the specificity of credit exposures, the methodology used is based on the probability of transition to term forfeiture, and on discounted loss rates after term forfeiture. These parameters are measured on a statistical basis for homogeneous populations.

    For exposures classified in stage 3, expected credit losses are measured as the value, discounted at the effective interest rate, of all cash shortfalls over the life of the financial instrument. Cash shortfalls represent the difference between the cash flows that are due in accordance with the contract, and the cash flows that are expected to be received. Where appropriate, the estimate of expected cash flows takes into account a cash flow scenario arising from the sale of the defaulted loans or groups of loans. Proceeds from the sale are recorded net of costs to sell.

    The methodology developed is based on existing concepts and methods (in particular the Basel framework) on exposures for which capital requirement for credit risk is measured according to the IRBA methodology. This method is also applied to portfolios for which capital requirement for credit risk is measured according to the standardised approach. Besides, the Basel framework has been adjusted in order to be compliant with IFRS 9 requirements, in particular the use of forward-looking information.

    ## Maturity

    All contractual terms of the financial instrument are taken into account, including prepayment, extension and similar options. In the rare cases where the expected life of the financial instrument cannot be estimated reliably, the residual contractual term is used. The standard specifies that the maximum period to consider when measuring expected credit losses is the maximum contractual period. However, for revolving credit cards and overdrafts, in accordance with the exception provided by IFRS 9 for these products, the maturity considered for measuring expected credit losses is the period over which the entity is exposed to credit risk, which may extend beyond the contractual maturity (notice period). For revolving credits and overdrafts to non-retail counterparties, the contractual maturity can be used, for example if the next review date is the contractual maturity as they are individually managed.

    ## Probabilities of Default (PD)

    Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon.

    The determination of the PD is based on the Group's internal rating system, which is described in chapter 5 of the Universal registration document (section 5.4 Credit risk - Credit risk management policy ). This section describes how environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks are taken into account in credit and rating policies, notably with the introduction of a new tool: the ESG Assessment .

    The measurement of expected credit losses requires the estimation of both 1-year probabilities of default and lifetime probabilities of default.

    1-year PDs are derived from long term average regulatory "through the cycle" PDs to reflect the current situation ("Point in Time" or "PIT").

    Lifetime PDs are determined based on the rating migration matrices reflecting the expected changes in the rating of the exposure until maturity, and the associated probabilities of default.

    ## Loss Given Default (LGD)

    Loss Given Default is the difference between contractual cash flows and expected cash-flows, discounted using the effective interest rate (or an approximation thereof) at the default date. LGD is expressed as a percentage of the Exposure At Default (EAD).

    The estimate of expected cash flows takes into account cash flows resulting from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements if they are part of the contractual terms and are not accounted for separately by the entity (for example, a mortgage associated with a residential loan), net of the costs of obtaining and selling the collateral.

    For guaranteed loans, the guarantee is considered as integral to the loan agreement if it is embedded in the contractual clauses of the loan, or if it was granted concomitantly to the loan, and if the expected reimbursement amount can be attached to a loan in particular (i.e. absence of pooling effect by means of a tranching mechanism, or the existence of a global cap for a whole portfolio). In such case, the guarantee is taken into account when measuring the expected credit losses. Otherwise, it is accounted for as a separate reimbursement asset.

    The LGD used for IFRS 9 purposes is derived from the Basel LGD parameters. It is adjusted for downturn and conservatism margins (in particular regulatory margins), except for margins for model uncertainties.

    ## Exposure At Default (EAD)

    Exposure At Default (EAD) of an instrument is the anticipated outstanding amount owed by the obligor at the time of default. It is determined by the expected payment profile taking into account, depending on the product type: the contractual repayment schedule, expected early repayments and expected future drawings for revolving facilities.

    ## Forward-looking information

    The amount of expected credit losses is measured on the basis of probability-weighted scenarios, in view of past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts.

    The approaches applied to take into account forward-looking information when measuring expected credit losses are detailed in note 2.g Cost of risk .

  questions_and_answers:
  - answer: Expected credit losses are defined as the present value of all cash shortfalls weighted by the probability of occurrence over the expected life of the financial instruments. They are measured on an individual basis for all exposures, with stage 1 focusing on 12-month risk and stage 2 covering the risk over the facility’s lifetime. In stage 3, expected credit losses are based on the discounted cash shortfalls expected over the life of the financial instrument.
    question: How are expected credit losses defined and measured for different stages according to the BNP Paribas Group’s policies for the first half of 2024?

  - answer: Probability of Default (PD) is an estimate of the likelihood that a borrower will default over a given time horizon. The 1-year PD reflects the current situation, while the lifetime PD is determined by using rating migration matrices that reflect expected changes in exposure ratings until maturity. These estimations are based on the Group's internal rating system and are adjusted to reflect forward-looking information.
    question: How does the BNP Paribas Group calculate Probability of Default (PD) when measuring expected credit losses in the first half of 2024?

  - answer: Loss Given Default (LGD) represents the difference between contractual cash flows and expected cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate at the default date. It is expressed as a percentage of the Exposure At Default (EAD). LGD also considers collateral, guarantees, or other credit enhancements tied to the loan agreement and adjusts based on downturn and conservatism margins as derived from the Basel framework.
    question: What is Loss Given Default (LGD), and how is it calculated by the BNP Paribas Group for the first half of 2024?

    BNP Paribas has the option of not paying interest due on these undated super subordinated notes. Unpaid interest is not carried forward.

    For notes issued before 2015, the absence of coupon payment is conditional on the absence of dividend payment on BNP Paribas SA ordinary shares or on undated super subordinated note equivalents during the previous year. Interest due is payable once dividend payment on BNP Paribas SA ordinary shares resumes.

    The contracts relating to these undated super subordinated notes contain a loss absorption clause. Under the terms of this clause, in the event of insufficient regulatory capital, the nominal value of the notes may be reduced in order to serve as a new basis for the calculation of the related coupons until the capital deficiency is made up and the nominal value of the notes is increased to its original amount.

    The proceeds from these issues are recorded in equity under "Capital and retained earnings". In accordance with IAS 21, issues denominated in foreign currencies are recognised at their historical value based on their translation into euros at the issue date. Interest on the instruments is treated in the same way as dividends.

    At 30 June 2024, the BNP Paribas Group held EUR 42 million of undated super subordinated notes which were deducted from shareholders' equity.
